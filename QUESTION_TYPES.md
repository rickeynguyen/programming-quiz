# Question Types - Aligned with College CS Exam Format

This document describes all question types the app can generate, mapped to typical college CS exam questions.

## 1. Basic Coding Questions
**Example from Test**: Question 2 (swap first/last elements)
**App Generates**: Function writing with specific requirements
- Students write complete function implementations
- Clear specifications provided
- Example inputs/outputs given

## 2. Multiple Choice Questions
**Example from Test**: Question 1(c), Question 3(a)(b)(c)
**App Generates**: Multiple choice with 4 options (A, B, C, D)
- Syntax and definition questions
- Behavior analysis questions
- Students can answer with just the letter

## 3. Code Comprehension
**Example from Test**: Question 1 (analyze function behavior)
**App Generates**: Code snippet with analysis questions
- 5-10 lines of code provided
- Questions about what it does, returns, or requires
- Tests understanding of code logic

## 4. Recursion Tracing
**Example from Test**: Question 3 (mystery function with recursion)
**App Generates**: Recursive function analysis
- How many times function is called
- Order of operations
- What values are computed at each step
- Base case identification

## 5. Output Prediction
**App Generates**: Code with "what will be the output?" question
- Shows code snippet
- Asks what prints/returns
- Tests execution understanding

## 6. Input Specification
**Example from Test**: Question 1(b) (provide inputs that return False)
**App Generates**: Given function, find specific inputs
- Shows function code
- Asks for inputs that produce specific output
- Tests reverse-engineering skills

## 7. Fill-in-the-Blank
**App Generates**: Code with blanks to complete
- Focus on syntax mastery
- Specific concepts like keywords, operators

## 8. Function Writing with Constraints
**Example from Test**: Question 4 (longest string function)
**App Generates**: Detailed function specifications
- Function name specified
- Parameters and return type defined
- Behavior requirements listed
- Example calls with expected outputs
- Constraints mentioned (e.g., "may not define other functions")

## 9. True/False Questions
**App Generates**: Statement about Python concept
- Student determines if true or false
- Often requires explanation

## 10. Conceptual Questions
**App Generates**: "Explain how X works" questions
- Tests deeper understanding
- Requires written explanations
- Not just memorization

## 11. Step-by-Step Execution
**App Generates**: Code with execution trace questions
- What happens at each step
- Final result after all operations
- Understanding of program flow

## Validation Features

### Flexible Answer Checking
- Multiple choice: Accepts "A", "a", "A)", "A) answer text"
- Code: Lenient on style, strict on logic
- Allows different variable names, spacing
- Checks correctness of algorithm, not formatting

### Detailed Feedback
- Shows correct answer when wrong
- Explains why answer is correct/incorrect
- Provides working code examples
- Offers simplified explanations (ELI5 mode)

## Recommended Topics for Exam Prep

Based on typical CS exams:
1. **functions** - Function definitions, parameters, return values
2. **recursion** - Recursive calls, base cases, execution tracing
3. **list manipulation** - Indexing, slicing, swapping elements
4. **string operations** - Length, concatenation, comparison
5. **conditional logic** - if/elif/else, boolean expressions
6. **loops and iteration** - for/while loops, iteration patterns
7. **list comprehensions** - Compact list creation
8. **function parameters and return values** - Parameter passing, return behavior

## Usage Tips for Students

1. **Start with fundamentals** - Choose "functions" or "conditional logic" topics
2. **Use ELI5** - Click "Explain Like I'm 5" for simplified explanations
3. **Practice recursion** - Select "recursion" topic for tracing practice
4. **Ask follow-ups** - Use "Chat about this question" for deeper understanding
5. **Review mistakes** - Read explanations carefully when you get answers wrong
6. **Add custom topics** - Add specific topics from your syllabus
